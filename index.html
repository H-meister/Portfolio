            <h2 class>About Me</h2>

            <h4>Hello! Welcome to my webpage all about me and my work!<h4>

                    <p>Here the purpose is to show and explain my journey and accomplishments throughout the years</p>

                    <h3>Cool stuff</h3>

                    <p>
                        I enjoy coding. I started to experience coding when I was little. It actually kind of started
                        with a game called Minecraft.
                        Minecraft is a sandbox type game where the goal is really whatever you set yourself to
                        accomplish.
                        The player can choose to survive or just to be creative. Currently Minecraft and its options
                        really inspired me to be out of the box and it implemented some first-time coding.
                        In Minecraft the player can actually type out commands and execute them like a terminal. It got
                        me excited to learn.
                        I started modding and kind of diverged but got reinspired when I was in high school.
                        I joined a programming club and had some computer science classes and learned VS basic and a
                        little bit of javascript.
                        Soon I was coding again.
                        Currently I am reliving my journey and continuing on this passion of mine and I hope you enjoy
                        what you see on my webpage built by yours truly ðŸ˜Š
                    </p>

                    <h3>Other Cool stuff/hobbies</h3>

                    <p>
                        Other than coding you can find me in the music field. I can play a good bit of musical
                        instruments my passion being piano.
                        I am inspired by those who have a musical talent and I was able to play in a ton of settings and
                        groups and is also a huge part of my life. I love music.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other than music I really like solving puzzles and actually have a pretty big Rubikâ€™s Cube
                        collection going on. Its super fun learning and solving puzzles for me!
                        and just recently I picked up on fishing with my buddy. On the left is me with my first ever
                        fish-on!
                    </p>
